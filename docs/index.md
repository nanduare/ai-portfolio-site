## Highlights
- Real-time IDS pipeline (Kafka â†’ Python â†’ Postgres/Redis): ROC-AUC ~0.95 and sub-250 ms p95 latency locally.
- Feature store + low-latency CTR serving (Redis + FastAPI): P99 reads ~3â€“10 ms; AUC ~0.78 on synthetic.
- ML algorithms implemented from scratch: matched sklearn within ~1â€“3% accuracy on benchmark datasets.
- Postgres index recommender: analyzed pg_stat_statements and validated wins with EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
