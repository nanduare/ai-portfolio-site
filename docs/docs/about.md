## About

I'm a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence at Indiana Wesleyan University, passionate about building reliable ML systems end-to-end: from data ingestion and feature engineering to training, serving, and monitoring.

- MS, Artificial Intelligence — Indiana Wesleyan University (in progress)
- BE, Computer Science — SRM University, Amaravati
- Interests: real-time streaming, feature stores, model evaluation, database internals, systems for ML.

I value clarity, measurable impact, and clean engineering. Outside of work, I stay active with sports and enjoy contributing to open-source.
